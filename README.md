# Boolean Network Modeling

The goal of this software package is to provide intuitive and accessible tools for simulating *biological regulatory networks*
in a boolean formalism. Using this simulator biologist and bioinformaticians can specify their system in a simple textual language then
explore various dynamic behaviors via a web interface or an application programming interface (API) each designed to facilitate scientific discovery,
data collection and reporting.

Latest release *1.2.7*, April 24th, 2014

# Installation instructions

The code requires Python 2.7. The simplest installation works through [conda][conda] installer that can maintain different versions of Python on the same machine. Install [conda][conda] then from the command line:

[conda]: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

```
# Create the python 2 environment.
conda create --name py2 python=2.7

# Activate the environment
conda activate py2

# Install matplotlib version 2.2
conda install matplotlib=2

# Install Booleannet
pip install booleannet
```

You can verify the installation by running test simulations:

```
# Download a test simulation
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ialbert/booleannet/master/examples/projects/LGL/LGL-simulation.py

# Run the test simulation 
python LGL-simulation.py
```

Bugfix Note
-----------

January 7, 2010. Please note that versions 1.2.0 to 1.2.4 of the BooleanNet package have  a bug that cause the node updates to execute in original (listed) order during the first iteration, before randomizing the order of nodes for subsequent iterations. This bug affects only the asynchronous update mechanism. 

The net effect of the bug is that for certain type of rules the first execution of them may funnel the states into the basin of one of the attractors. Overall the answers will not be incorrect but, depending on the rules and order of nodes they may be incomplete. Please update to the latest version. My apologies. Istvan Albert

Introduction
------------

When trying to understand the role and functioning of a regulatory network,
the first step is to assemble the components of the network and the interactions
between them. The experimental advances in the large scale mapping of regulatory networks are fairly recent, but modeling efforts date back to the end of 1960s thanks to the pioneering work of Stuart Kauffman and Rene Thomas.

In a Boolean representation we assume that nodes are equivalent, and their interactions form a directed graph in which each node receives inputs from its neighbors (nodes that are connected to it). The state of nodes is described by binary (ON/OFF) variables, and the dynamic behavior of each variable, that is, whether it will be ON or OFF at next moment, is governed by a Boolean function. In general, a Boolean or logical function is written as a statement acting on the inputs using the logical operators *and*, *or* and *not* and its output is ON(OFF) if the statement is true (false).

About the library
-----------------

*Note* as of version 1.2 (Nov 12, 2008) the library has acquired several new features (see below) and underwent a substantial reorganization. To keep old code from interfering with new one the library namespace has been changed to *boolean2*

In this software package, we implement mutliple advanced methodologies which combine discrete logical rules with more realistic assumptions regarding the relative timescales of the  processes:

  * *synchronous* updates are performed in listed order, but the states change only at the end of the update round
  * *asynchronous* updates are performed in random order and the states immediately reflect the changes, this makes the model stochastic. 
  * *ranked asynchronous* updates are performed in rank order, within the same rank the updates take place asynchronously
  * *time synchronous* update are performed in time. Each rule has a time delay associated with them, updates take place at multiples of these delays
  * *piece wise differential* updates associate a set of continuous variables (concentrations, decay rates and thresholds) to each discrete variable in the system. The dynamics of these continuous variables is determined by a _linear system of piecewise differential equations_, leading to a *hybrid model* in the manner first suggested by Leon Glass and collaborators.

Example Rules
-------------

Here are a few example rules for *BooleanNet* covering various research projects. Most of these rules were collected via a thorough literature search and were manually curated into their final form. These rules are available in the *examples/samples* directory of the source code distribution.
